            <h1>Meet the bots that will make learning GREAT again</h1>
            <p>Studies that looked at delayed vs. immediate feedback discovered that participants
            who were given immediate feedback showed a significantly larger increase in
            performance than those who had received delayed feedback.<br /><br />
            Our chatbots enable students to get answers right away using machine learning
            to parse through course materials. TAs and faculty are also relieved of routine
            question-answering.</p>
